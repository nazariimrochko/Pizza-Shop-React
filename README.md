# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To start a project, enter:

### `npm start`
### `npx json-server --watch public/db.json --port=3003`

# Project settings:

## Globally:

### `npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev`
### `npm add react-router-dom`
### `npm install redux`
### `npm install react-redux`
### `npm add axios`

## Additionally for stylization:

### `npm install class names`
### `npm add scss`

## Install the JSON server:

### `npm add --dev json-server`
### `json server - see db.json`

## Auxiliary Libraries:

### `npm install redux-thunk` 
(for working with actions and asynchronous actions)
### `npm add prop-types` 
(a separate library responds to reproduce the correct receipt of data in which formats they come)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
